# ML-Based Anomly Detection in System Security:

-This project integrates the concepts of Operating Systems and Machine Learning to create an anomaly/ intrusion detection sytem using unsupervised deep learning models.
The goal is to detect and identify suspicious activities and potential security threats that may lead to a deadlock situation thus, harming the entire operating system.

Features:
1. Real-time anomaly detection
2. Visualization of system metrics for analysis
3. Training and evaluating models (Autoencoders)
4. Alerting systems for threat log entries.

Technologies Used:
1.Python
2.Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
3.Tensorflow
4.Matplotlib
5.HTML and CSS
6.JavaScript
7.Flask

Usage:
1.Model Training
2.Model Testing
3.Frontend for Dashboard.
4.Backend for real-time threat detection.
